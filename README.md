This project was created by Claude based on the following prompt:

Can you create a simple calculator that takes as input numerical expressions such as "2+3/5" and outputs the result. The code should be written using Delphi object pascal and must use LLVM to create the evaluator. You can use the Delphi bindings to LLVM that I have attached

The code uses the libLLVM by Jarrod Davis which can be found here
